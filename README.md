Genome Size and Nutrients Influence AMF Associations

R scripts used for Blackwell, A. and Hersch-Green E.I. "Scripts used for the paper: "Mechanistic insights into plant community responses to environmental variables: genome size, cellular nutrient investments, and metabolic trade-offs"

"GS-AMF_Forb_StatisticalAnalysis.txt" - Code for phylogenetic signal and PGLMM analyses for data on genome size, plot treatment, biomass, and percent arbuscule, hyphae, and vesicle colonization. LM analyses for grasses was done in JMP Pro 18.

The data used in this script can be found in the Supplemental Material S3.
